<p>Light is such a simple thing and my job is to get it to light up.

A simple electrical circuit is pretty much straight forward. just make the + and the - end meet from the power source to the light bulb and it works! Today is a little different as I need to make the bulb light up using a computer.

I picked up an Arduino kit from the campus computer store which has all the parts needed to make this run for $92.&nbsp;

<p>We don't give it much thought when we turn on a light bulb. For us  it's just a flick of the switch and that's it! So it shouldn't be too  much trouble. Or could it?

I picked up the ITP PCOMP kit at the NYU Computer Store for around  $95 including taxes. Inside it's a box of chips, LEDs, wires, boards,  cables and so on to supposedly help me make magic.</p></p>
