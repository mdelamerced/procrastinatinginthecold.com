<p>It's the start of the school year and some problems will be back. Like people who leave stuff on the sink. One of my ideas uses the concept of sensor on the bottom of the sink. If it goes beyond a certain weight. No water can be released by the faucet. I know this seems to defeat the purpose of actually washing the dishes in hindsight. But maybe it might be enough incentive for people to actually wash the dishes.

I remember during water shortages back home, water was only available on certain times of the day. This meant everyone was done with the dishes, cooking, bathing and so on before 9pm and we'd all be sleeping early.

Another is for people to actually put the deposit bottles in the right bin. Sometimes there are just too many bins on the floor that it's sometimes confusing on what goes in which bin.
 But what if there's a pot of money based on the deposit money collected from the bottles deposited.
