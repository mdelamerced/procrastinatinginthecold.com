While walking around Central Park yesterday to shoot for our Big Screens project this semester we came upon this.

It's a section of The Lake over here.

Apparently it's caused by the warm summer weather and current cooler conditions as well as water currents has driven all the algae in the Lake to this corner.

I wasn't too happy with the image so I went for the black and white effect.

I'm curious to know which feels better.</p>
