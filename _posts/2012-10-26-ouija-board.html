<p>This is not a post about the supernatural. This is actually a post for an idea.

I used to work for a large news organization (at least 800 people) and one of the problems with such a large group is personel deployment. Keeping track of hundreds of journalists and assets alongside breaking stories is a superhuman feat. When all the user has to go through is spreadsheet like interface, duplicate assignments and overlapping stories occur.

With this problem in mind I thought of aircraft carrier operations, this is where the <a href="http://www.airspacemag.com/military-aviation/How_Things_Work_The_Ouija_Board.html" target="_blank">ouija board</a> comes in. &nbsp;Up until last year, the US Navy used an analog board inside the operations deck of an aircraft carrier to keep track of everything that is happening on the flight deck.<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/ouija-board-vital-on-us-aircraft-carriers-2012-10?op=1" target="_blank"> It provides the users a real time snapshot on what's happening on deck.</a> One of the reasons for the navy to stick to such an analog system for tracking one of the most advanced military equipment is that in the event of an attack and the ship is damaged, the ouija board will continue to fucntion.&nbsp;

However, as of last year they have <a href="http://www.stripes.com/news/navy/old-school-ouija-board-being-phased-out-on-navy-carriers-1.151711" target="_blank">decided to switch to a digital format </a>with some resistance from their end users.&nbsp;

So I was thinking of building a similar thing for newsroom operations. But instead of an aircraft carrier flight deck, I would use a map layer of the city. As news feeds come it, hotspots are generated on the table which identify areas that have the most news reports at that time. Another layer will use the news assets such as reporters, satellites, cameramen and so on to provide the fastest response available.

I was thinking of using Processing for this project or OpenFrameworks but it's still a very early idea. I may, or may not build this but this will require much more thought and research.</p>
