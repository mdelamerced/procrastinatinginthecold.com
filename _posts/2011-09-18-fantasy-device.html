<p>This week's installment is asking for a fantasy device that I would like to build. I may be taking fantasy a bit too far when I think of this. Remember in the movie Dune (1984), where Paul Atredies has to put his hand into a box, fast forward to 2:12 to see this. The box will determine if he's human.

<object width="420" height="315">
<param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/yIDtN8CDQmk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="always" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/yIDtN8CDQmk?version=3&amp;hl=en_US" allowscriptaccess="always" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>

Not the Gom Jabbar, but the box. I remember this device from the Penny Arcade in Disneyland where you grab hold of two metal rods and see how much pain or in this clase electricity can you withstand before letting go. To track your progress, there's a meter which measures the amount of electricity channeling though.

But how much electricity can I get from a USB port or even a 9V batter to do this? But regardless of the electrical feedback needed. I can see the setup is as follows.

I see it as simple wooden box with an LCD screen on top and an opening on the side with black curtain to "hide" the secrets of the box. The device will start once the hand is placed inside and connects the two parts of sheet metal to complete the circuit. On the LCD above, one sees a "representational image" of the hand.

This sketch shows a little bit more on the insides of the box. The LCD above is connected to a mac mini below which runs all the visuals that appear on the display. There's a USB camera positioned underneath the display to detect the hand. the walls are either lined with IR sensors or something similar so we can see what's going on inside the box. There will a a 9V batter which will power an arduino chip that will return the electricity in gradual amounts back to the user the longer the user keeps his hand inside the box.

I know this machine seems a little sadistic but I'd like to see how people would react if small electrical currents are being sent to the hand but the user is seeing someting else happen to the hand via the display. Will it be more painful? How much is the pain imagined compared to the actual nerve endings of the hand? I may not actually build this right away, but I do have to start somewhere. If this goes anywhere, I will update as necessary.
