Inspiration for this homework came during lunch. I discovered the <a title="Sapporo" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sapporo-new-york" target="_blank">Sapporo</a> Restaurant shortly after my ITP group interview in January and instantly fell in love with the place.

It's a nice small ramen nook on 49th just off the N or the R train. The place gets full pretty fast by Barclay employees across the street, I could always find a seat for myself on the bar.

Today I tried the "shio ramen" or salt based soup stock ramen bowl. The lack of AT&amp;T data coverage in the restaurant due to the erratic signal they provide, I instead read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-with-Processing-ebook/dp/B003VTZXD6/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&amp;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&amp;qid=1315503511&amp;sr=8-1" target="_blank">"Getting Started with Processing"</a> on my Kindle. I had purchased the book 3 months ago and got as far as the 5th chapter before starting again to prepare for my homework.

Then it hit me. Why not turn my lunch into my homework.

Getting the code running was simple enough but I had to employ some other codes not initially learned in class.

Now making just a bowl with chopsticks was the initial plan. But then it seemed to lack certain elements. It was too flat for me. I decided to create a little bit of depth by creating gradient ellipses for the bowl then just added some fake eggs, spring onions (or is it leeks) and ramen noodles by playing around with the fill command and ellipses command.

For the ramen and spring onions I experiments by using variables to create a mass of these elements so I don't have to keep copy pasting the code and altering every bit and position.

I'm sure I can randomize this in the future with less steps but it serves it's for now.

I initially wrote the code for the onions then I thought I should just copy paste the whole thing for the ramen. Then I learned that you can't use the same variables in the same project so I had to rename the variables for the ramen part from x to a and so on. But then it didn't look all that random when all I did was just add 1 to x and y. So to give a semblance of disorder, I played around with the integers which resulted in it's final incarnation.

It just needed a little bit of more tweaking in terms of the position of the objects in the screen and in the bowl and there you have it.
