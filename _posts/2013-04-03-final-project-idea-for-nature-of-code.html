<a href="http://vimeo.com/61426703">work in progress</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user8482915">Melissa A. dela Merced</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a>.

I'm thinking of expanding my midterm idea for the final project.

My project is largely inspired by a scene in Star Wars' Return of the Jedi. Everyone almost always wants to be the Jedi and no one wants to be in the dark side. My project involves bolts of lightning or particles come from the hands as seen in this clip (before the emperor dies of course).

Or maybe in Dragon Ball Z.

For the midterms I used the hand gesture to track my hand movements using the simpleopenNI library for Processing. For the finals I'll be using the skeletal tracking to get both hands.

By putting the hands together it will increase activity of the particles surround the hands.

And by pointing the hands in a area in the screen will direct the 'bolts of Sith Lord power' across the direction it is pointing at.

Lightning will be generated using fractal math. I think. Which we will learn in a few weeks.
