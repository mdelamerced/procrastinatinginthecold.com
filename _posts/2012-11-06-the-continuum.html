<p>Back when the internet was new for me and I had just switched jobs, I began to be active in the Star Trek Community. This group is not just a bunch of fans talking about Star Trek. This was a bunch of fans talking about Star Trek with the producers!!

This was before blogs, before twitter and social media we came together in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat" target="_blank">IRC</a>. At any time of the day you could go in and chat will fellow trekkers about anything but the one thing that brought people together was Star Trek.

Moderators would host trivia contests and I have once won a Trilithium Ribbon for beating everyone in the Star Trek: Deep Space Nine trivia.

The biggest perks of this was that occasionally, they would host celebrity chats where fans could ask questions. And on October 30, 1998 there was a special chat with Terry Farrell who played Jadzia Dax on Deep Space Nine and they asked my question!

Sadly when CBS purchased Paramount Pictures the Star Trek Continuum team were all fired and the entire site changed. The transcript of the chat is no longer hosted on the official website but it's still mirrored <a href="http://www.reocities.com/trekguide/transcripts/farrell2.txt" target="_blank">elsewhere</a>.

As with everything with life and it's fleeting moments, I had to move on beyond Star Trek. So it came as a shock when I found out that the husband and wife, Ben and Syl who were such a big part of the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080709024200/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/16038.html" target="_blank">community</a> <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050206024820/http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/news/article/9471.html" target="_blank">passed away.</a>

It feels eerily creepy as our sites were hosted on Geocities before, they have passed, but their website still lives on.

This prompted me to immortalize the experience. I first thought of printing the question and answer on paper. But then I've done that already. I wanted it to a bit more special. Since I moved apartments, I haven't put anything on the walls yet. They look so empty and bare. I also want only items on the wall that I really like of course but if possible something I made.

I decided to etch it on a sheet of plexi I had lying around.&nbsp;

This will hang on my wall.&nbsp;
