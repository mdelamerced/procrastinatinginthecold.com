<p>In two weeks I'll be embarking on a journey that will take me across the country. But after taking a breather and exmaining my capabilities, I've shortened the journey and changed it.

The cross country train ride would have been amazing since it's not a  road, it is not part of Google Earth Street View. That alone was  difficult. Not to mention I mapped the ride to Chicago and it was very  long.

I've decided to drive up the California coast instead. Specifically the area of California Highway 1 between San Luis Obispo and San Francisco.

I drove there the first time in the spring of 2010 in a Nissan Hybrid with my sister. This time around I'll be travelling knowing what I'll need. The difference today is that I'll be equipping the car I'll be using with a number of cameras that would almost make it look like a Google Street View car but in simpler terms. I've marked the series of stops and places I intend to visit and the entire journey will take me three days.

There's something to be said about a road trip. This documentary narrates some of the history of the road and will attempt to capture the unique views only visible on this road. One of the driving factors for me on this documentary is the possiblity that this road may no longer exist in it's current state in the next ten years. Though no fault of man. The Pacific ocean is slowly eating away at the cliffs and eroding the land beneath the it.

The drive is also very special. The trip will take me to a twisting part of the highway where I never bothered to look at the speed limit. The speed limit is a distraction at that point and it's not posted anyway. I think it would be even better if I can get my hands on a manual transmission car for this, but I doubt I'll be able to find one.

I have part of the script for the narrative bits and rest would be in the car. This is very exciting.</p>
