This week in Comics, we adapted T.C. Boyle's short story, "The Ape in Retirement" into 6 panels of comic book form. It was a challenge in figuring out what to keep and what to take away and my process has resulted in this.

While on the train, I sketched out scenes that were important and significant in moving the story forward. Even the it was told through the eyes of the female protagonist, Beatrice. The actions all belong to Konrad the ape.

This is the final sketch in panels. I chose to focus on the face of Konrad for his ability to express emotions similar to humans. Though my sketches are crude, I was making an attempt to show how Konrad was reacting to the events around him. Given more time I would narrated it through Beatrice's words but Konrad's actions.</p>
