<p>This particular homework was problematic at the coding level at first. Working with Alex, my assigned partner we figured out on how we'd like to animate our projects and went to work.

I went through 3 different revisions of the code posted last week since now I had to add "void setup" and "void draw". One will setup the set elements into the sequence and the other will animate.

The bowl was problematic at first as it kept saying I was mixing "active" and "static" elements. I then moved the bowl code to be included in the "void setup" command and it worked! Now the problem was how to animate.

At first I could get the "mousePressed" command to work properly. I gave up on that code at first and moved on to another code to use. I ended up without control in the case of my ramen. Everywhere I moved my mouse it just spread the "ramen" code all over the screen.

So in frustration I gave it a rest. Then in one lazy Sunday morning I figured it out! It turns out that I lacked a closed curly bracket

And here's the final <a href="http://itp.nyu.edu/~mdm532/ICM/week02/" target="_blank">product</a>. Click on the mouse to add the ramen and for the final touch, press the spacebar for the eggs, spring onions and chopsticks. Enjoy!
