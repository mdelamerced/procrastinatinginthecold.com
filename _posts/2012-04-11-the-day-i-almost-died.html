title: The day I almost died

<p>In 2006, I was inspired the team who went up Mt. Everest with the Philippine Everest Expedition and wanted to go there too. When they came back, they said it was the most amazing place they have every seen.

So in 2011, after I learned I got accepted into ITP, my father and fellow photographer Patrick Uy decided to make it happen. We had been aware of the expedition in 2006 and 2007 since we were involved in it one way or another. Patrick contacted the same trekking company the expedition used.

Henry and Emma Pariyar of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/International-Adventures-Treks-Expeditions/183336705039011" target="_blank">International Adventures Treks and Expeditions</a> handled the entire journey. We took a Cathay Pacific flight from Manila to Hong Kong and switched to a Dragon Air flight from Hong Kong to Kathmandu via Dhaka. The plane trip took almost the entire day and we arrived in Nepal at midnight.

We were greeted by Henry and Emma at the airport. We got our visa upon arrival and headed to the hotel. During the dry season, Nepal undergoes 8 hour power interruptions. Meaning the city was very dark and I do mean very dark. Bull mastiffs run free through the streets and it seemed that a map would actually be useless in navigating the streets.

Essential things to bring to Nepal. A flashlight, which my father lost 2 days later :( so we had to buy a new one. There is excellent mobile signal in the city but up in the mountains, you'll only get them in big towns. I'll get to that later.

Our journey took us 7 days over the Annapurna range of the Himalayas. It may not be Everest Base Camp (that takes at least 10 days) but enough to take pictures.

We rode a van from Kathmandu to Bandipur and stayed overnight. It gave us a glimpse on what was to come.

From Bandipur we headed to the lakeside town of Pokhara where we would leave our belongings before heading to the mountains.

It was another van ride to the start of the trek at Nayapul. Here we met with our guides and porters and set off just before 9am.

It's here in Birethanti (elev. 1065m)&nbsp; where supplies are replenished and brought up the mountains on the backs of mules. You need to step aside when they pass since they have a tendency to bump you off the cliff if you're in the way.

This is also the last part where vehicular traffic can pass since the roads are still being built.

Since electricity is something of a rare commodity up in the mountains, I had a solar panel on my backpack as I went on the trail slowly charging my iPod or iPhone. It wasn't much but enough to help me have some touch with civilization with my playlist.

Don't fall into the water. There are leeches.

Just beyond the structures up there is where we would be staying for the night.

We arrived at Tikhedhunga (elevation 1525m) a little past five and had dinner and slept.

Traditional Nepali dish.

The following day was going to be the killer. But we didn't know it then. We set off at 6am for Ghorepani (elevation 2775m).

The trek to the next town was tough. Ulleri was a steep acent of 1,300m.

<a title="nepal 106 by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/5745313246/"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5062/5745313246_3b8a032457.jpg" alt="nepal 106" width="500" height="374" /></a>

<a title="nepal 108 by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/5744769509/"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2615/5744769509_034436d349.jpg" alt="nepal 108" width="500" height="374" /></a>

We had only hit part of Ulleri by lunchtime and it would be difficult to make it to Ghorepani by sunset. Our trek was not made any easier by the afternoon rainshowers. We were getting really tired. By 5pm we were still at least an hour away from Ghorepani and we were basically out of energy bars, water, eletrolytes and warm clothing. It was hot in humid during the day and it started to snow as the sun went down. Our guides were worried that I might be suffering from altitude sickness. But I wasn't. Each step was painful and my body was telling me to stop. Stop here for the night. It'll be ok. Apparently we were all in the same predicament. We were all just waiting for someone to say it. But nobody did.

As the sun went down the rain slowly turned into snow and at this point we didn't have flashlight. There was nothing else in my mind but the next step. Each step was closer to a hot meal and a bed. During the trek, all sorts of things could fill your mind. There was the view, the odd thing that you would see along the path and checking on how much water we had left. But not at 6pm in the snow. We finally reached Ghorepani just before the sun went completely down.

Last photo for the day. Entrance to Ghorepani.

Then I learned that it was another 30-45 minutes uphill to reach the lodge for the night. Crap.

I was feeling much better now that we reached the town and our goal for the day was within reach. </p>
