title: The most disturbing toy I've ever seen
layout: post
---
<p>We are all familiar with Barbie dolls and any other doll that represents the female figure that is given to girls to play with as a toy. Each toy may have intended secondary motive such as either teaching you on how to color coordinate your clothes or just plain fun.

Dolls come another set of clothes, shoes and accessories. Something that every girl should have. But this toy has one thing I have never seen in the many years I have spent in toy stores.

This is intentionally named "Teenage Pregnancy Beautiful". SEROUSLY!?!

The dolls is basically everything that Barbie is but this one is PREGNANT!&nbsp;

Coupled with a tiny baby inside the doll's belly.

Something must have been lost in translation as this toy was made in China and eventually sold in the Philippines and apparently people are buying this toy. I was afraid to ask why they were buying this toy and apparently it sells well for the simple fact. IT'S WEIRD!!&nbsp;

Though some people who buy this rarely give it to their children but instead keep it for them for the sheer novelty.

It boggles my mind why someone would actually make a toy like this. They can name this toy any way they like. But I still believe that it is wrong and disturbing.&nbsp;
