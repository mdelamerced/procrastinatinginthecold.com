<p>For 36 hours this week I was watching the kitchen sink that sits in the lounge for purposes that shall reveal itself next week. It's interesting what people do there.

Like catching someone leaving their dish in the sink. (Sorry Mick)

How these two stayed here from 1 pm (I started watching) until the floor closed.

And then some.

This morning before the floor opened.
