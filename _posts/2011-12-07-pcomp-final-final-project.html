More or less. Working with small parts is very difficult especially with 30 gauge wire which is barely a thread and breaks easily which is one of the main problems I encountered with this project.

The code is working great. But I may have crossed some wires that make the white array and yellow array stay on all the time. But the effect is there. I'm at a point where I don't want to touch it anymore for fear that it may not work by noon today. I am honestly not satisfied with my work but the important part is I learned a lot with this project in terms of building and fabrication which I really need to work on.

Right now it's all packed up in a box for transportation to the ITP floor. Thank you for a wonderful experience in Physical Computing.
