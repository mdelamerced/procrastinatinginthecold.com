<p>Though a room is tecnically an inanimate object, I see it as a living thing. I try to spend time in my apartment as much as possible since I already spen too much of it in school as it is. My room will slowly breakdown if I do not clean it, repaint it and so on. It would be empty without the furniture or the Tibetan prayer flags that hang from my window. Laughter and the sound of people in the room provide it warmth or other elements that give it personality.

This brings me to the readings on how the author thinks how ants, dolphins and even penguins communicate to one another. Understandable that these are animals where there is a level communication not discernable to us humans but between them, there is understanding. It interesting that plants are a bit chided in the discussion of the story since it doesn't seem that plants do not communicate.

This brings me to my room. I believe that physical objects are alive. A combination of physical objects may be an organism. Or it could be just my brain attempting to connect everything together.&nbsp;

Which brings me to something I've always wanted to do but couldn't find the time to do it. Record myself in the room without me consciously in the room. The original recording is 8 hours so this is a snippet of eight minutes instead of me sleeping between the hours of 4-5am.
