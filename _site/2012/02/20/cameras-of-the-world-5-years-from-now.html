<p>There are views that more cameras out there could mean two things. One is that We can finally get a grasp on what&rsquo;s going on in the world. No longer can dictators and criminals hide from us. For once we can finally generate our own opinions on subjects that before, took an army of journalists to capture and analyze. We can finally have our own opinion. Then of course there&rsquo;s the downside. It&rsquo;s who is behind the cameras is the scary part. We already live part in that world. Our every movement is captured and stored into servers for who knows how long.

Cameras enabled it&rsquo;s creators to preserve their time and space and it continues to do so today. The 2011 Japan Earthquake was so devastating that we were getting live images as the tsunami swept through the northern region. Users shared their videos of the quake as it was happening and for the first time, the word could see terrible disaster live.

I for one would like to be optimistic about where technology is leading us in terms of cameras. I long for the images of the old cities in my home. I wish I could re-create the city the way it was before World War II or even better, re-create Old Manila during the Spanish era. We would be able to take a walk into history so to speak, understand and experience the place and time where my grandparents and great-grandparents lived. Like a living holodeck based on information from the past.

Cameras are something we fear about today. But it&rsquo;s something that our descendants would look for in the future.</p>
