<p>We were asked to list possible ideas for a documentary that we can complete this semester so here's what I came up with. So on the flight back to NY I came up with this list.

1.) *Woody Allen&rsquo;s Manhattan/ New York
 2.) Recycling day/ reusable bags/ plastic bag consumption
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hate the recycling system of NY that it has to be in bags. Feels so 3rd world. That's how they collect garbage in my neighborhood back home.
 3.)* hybrid or petrol cars
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why hybrid
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why petrol
 4.) Winter in New York
 5.) Do you know where your water comes from?
 6.) Email and letters
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do letters have a greater impact?
 7.) What&rsquo;s in a New York minute? Why does it feel that time moves faster in New York than in any other city I've been to?
 8.) What&rsquo;s in the cameraphone pictures?
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; why use your cameraphone?
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has it turned into something else?
 9.) Train ride along the atlantic coast or cross country during spring break
 10.) All in the family.

The ones with a "*" were presented in class.

My comments on each topic:

1. I've been a fan of Woody Allen's films since I saw Manhattan in one of my film classes in 1994. I think that no other filmmaker has shot that many films in one city for more than 30 years. Using geolocation, it's possible to factor in the locationsas well as the scenes from his movies. There are places that he revisits after 10 movies and uses them again. My documentary would visit the places research on the film and the location and significance for the American auteur.

2. Recyling here in NY is madness. I find it weird that you would have to store your recyclables or let's just say segregate our garbage into plastic bags. Isn't the point of recycling is to get rid of the plastic. Not to mention that someone has to physically pick up the garbage from your curb because trashbins work because someone will steal it. Seriously?!

3. The debate between alternative energy is if interest to be especially when it comes to automobiles. There is more to commercial hybrid cars and petrol cars than most people realize. For example, petrol cars run and will consume the gas that is in the tanks. But as the vehicle gets lighter, the car becomes less fuel hungry (unless of course you're driving a 3.0 liter engine that just guzzles the gas). Then there's the hybrid, the batteries don't get lighter as you drive longer thus keeping your car at almost the same weight it started with. Then there's the issue with the electric cars, how far will it actually run?

4. Winter in New York I was told is quite an experience. I was here this time last year in between blizzards for the group interview at ITP and it was brutal. But sadly I don't think this might work out since it's only snowed twice the whole time I've been at ITP and one of them was in October.

5. Just a thought on where the city water comes from. On second thought I don't think I'd like to know.

6. There is a digital divide when it comes to emails and letters. Why does  it feel more special when you receive a letter from someone compared to  an email? Why do letters mean more to your senator or congressman (1  letter = 2000 constituents) than an email campaign?

7. title speaks for itself.

8. Cameraphones has replaced the Polaroid and the snapshot in an instant. Why? why why why? Is there room left for the professional?

9. I was facinated by American trains in particular form one business trip to DC. I was coming from Richmond, VA and instead of renting a car, I decided to take the train. It was a pleasant surprise seeing another side of the country. I think railways were built first before roads because roads were was just dirt trampled over by horses and herds. Railways on the other hand are deliberate paths built to get from point A to point B. Even more so in the United States where it connected the East and Weat coast as Americans settled further west. I think a spring break train ride would be perfect for this.

10. I would like to build an online documentation on WWII survivors in the Philippines. Though most of the survivors are gone I would like to focus on my family. My gradparents had very different backgrounds and their stories of survival is something that is interesting to document. Sadly though, there might not be enough pictures even to document the whole thing. But still, I think I may return to this idea when I go back home.

So there you have it! 10 ideas for documentaries but I'm focusing on 1 and 9. Will post more as I elaborate on the idea.</p>
