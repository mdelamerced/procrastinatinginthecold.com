<p>This week's assignment has made me look at the different ways I actually get around. Though now I spend time searching for places to eat and directions on Google Maps or my iPhone, there are still some basic skills and some jargon I use in order to get around and identify locations.

Let's begin with the subway. Before coming to ITP, the last time I extensively used the subway was in 1997. So after the events of 9/11, the New York transit system drastically changed. Thus train routes that I once used are no longer running in the same place.

So we all know more or less the NYC subway system.&nbsp;

By sheer text data without the line representation or colors I know that I can get to school from my apartment on the Downtown N.&nbsp;

Or I can use the DwQ -N, R-N, 4/5-6.

I can get to JFK from ITP using the Up6-R-E.

Or just walk to W4th street and just take the E all the way.

Even though Google Maps attempts to include an estimated travel time for their destinations, unless I am in Germany, I don't think the times of arrival and departure of the trains are accurate.

I may not have an app or an actual map, but I do have a system that I can write down that can be understood in less than 5 minutes.

Now for another way of looking at cities. Race tracks.

I'm a big fan of autoracing having grown up on that influence and it made me think of a trip to Monaco. It was my first time in the principality and it was very disorienting once we got out the train station. My father wanted to get to Casino Square.&nbsp;

We were getting nowhere arguing with each other until it dawned on him and asked me in what race corner is Casino Square to which I replied, the 3rd corner and that were were on the turn 1. So we proceeded to head towards the direction of turn 3.

Most classic race tracks in Europe are partially built over city roads such as Circuit de la Sarthe in Le Mans.

and the new Singapore F1 race track,

&nbsp;

All the turns are played over and over again on television which makes identification of streets and landmarks quite easy without a physical map.

Another way of getting around New York is through Woody Allen's films.

Most Woody Allen films are shot entirely in New York and can provide a great <a href="http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/m/manhattan.html" target="_blank">guide</a> to the city.</p>
