<p>I've always wanted to get out of the house. I remember waiting in the garage when I was little and would beg to ride in any car that was leaving the house. Whether it was picking up my brother or sister from school, or just to get groceries. My nanny even took me on my first public bus ride. Just anything to get somewhere. That desire for travelling got me on an 8 hour road trip to the province one day and I gave up at the 6th hour.

Road trips have been an integral part of my growing up. My father worked a lot and the one time that we get to spend a lot of time together were either on vacations and most of it included a road trip of some sort. We even went out of town one time without bringing any food or some sort. This was before Starbucks and McDonalds put up rest stops along the highway.

These trips were always exciting. There was a time we could drive from Manila to Baguio (approximately 244 km) in 2 1/2 hours compared to the usual 4. Don't tell my mom. She wasn't with us at the time.

In these trips I would learn about our family history in some places. My grandmother would tell stories about every town we passed by. Like the moment she first saw my grandfather. She would sweep in front of the house when my grandfather's bus (he was a bus conductor) would stop every afternoon. She would tell on how My grandfather and his best friend would smuggle rice into the city to trade for medicine during World War II. My father would point at the elementary school and bakery he used to work in. Stories that aren't written in history books but in the roads and towns that we passed.

My siblings and I learned how to "attack" corners and overtake vehicles during these trips. My brother recieved the most instruction and my sister learned how to drive in winter conditions. I on the other hand learned how to maintain speed through corners in wet and dry conditions and hear the car complain as the traction control set in (Yes Yosemite I'm talking to you).

I'm inspired to make this documentary because this is the first long road trip I'm taking by myself. The United States is one of the few countries that is "safe" enough for me to do this and documenting it is essential. I draw inspiration from the blogs at <a href="http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/" target="_blank">crazyguyonabike.com</a> and Roff Smith's <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Cold_beer_and_crocodiles.html?id=Sh62AAAAIAAJ" target="_blank">Cold Beer and Crocodiles </a>. Even though these trips were made on a bicycles, the spirit of adventure is there.

Have you ever felt that moment when you've been driving for a long time that the car becomes an extension of your senses?

There's something about the car that makes you feel in control of your life. Well at least in my point of view.
