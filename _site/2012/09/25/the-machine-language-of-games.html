<p>The initial paragraph of the reading caught my eye where machines will actually write things for us that we can understand.</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;

<span style="font-size: 18.000000pt; font-family: 'ArialMT';">&ldquo;the most ignorant person, at a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labour, might write books in philosophy, poetry, politics, laws, mathematics, and theology, without the least assistance from genius or study.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span>

&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>My answer to this would actually be Livejournal but as the text continues. I could relate this in the early days of videogame production with Japanese videogames in particular.

My family grew up surrounded by poorly translated Japanese robot cartoons alongside Japanese videogames where there were no available translations to English. If there were, it usually looked like this.&nbsp;

Most famously known meme, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us" target="_blank">"All your base are belong to us."</a>

I have never played the game but the meme has stuck with gamers . Reading through the wikipedia entry, it lists side by side the comparison with the original Japanese text alongside the translation of the game as it appeared and an accurate translation of the text.

I can only imagine what went through the translation process. But if I were to analyze it, it would have probably just a guy with a Japanese to English dictionary just plain copying what was on screen without any context.

Today's videogames have vastly improved with teams of Japanese and English translators thus bringing everything into context.

On to the next step, have the machine translate things for us.

I've been playing a MMORPG since 2003 called Final Fantasy XI Online. It's pretty unique in such a way that they do not separate users by country or language. Which means you can be playing alongside players who can only speak, English, Japanese, German, French and so on. With this in mind, the game developers created an auto translate function in the game to allow players to interact with those they could not normally play with.

Though most users have used the service. It is by no means a point of lenghtly conversation but instead bridges the communication gap to be able to play. This type of machine generated text provided more tawdry phrases from the users like,</p><blockquote><p>{Galka} &nbsp;{meat} &nbsp;{rod} &nbsp;{Do you need it?}</p></blockquote><p>As for myself actually experiencing machine produced text would be my current game on my Nintendo 3DS. I will bring to class to demonstrate.

In the game Final Fantasy Theathrythm is a music game that adds a twist to playing it. You play through the music while replaying scenes from classic FInal Fantasy games. You choose characters and level them up as you play. Before each "battle", instead of a regular loading screen, a dynamic screen pops out that generates text based on the characters you choose (sometimes) and displays a phase that is sometimes coherent or utter nonsense.

The text goes on and on with every gameplay. It might be just trying to play into the quirkyness of Japanese English. But this text placed in the context of the Final Fantasy franchise will make sense. Could we just be lacking the knowledge to comprehend the text delivered by these machines? Or is it the machine trying to tell us something?&nbsp;

Which brings me to Watson.&nbsp;

Watson is an IBM supercomputer built to understand the human language and interact with it. It has a database filled with encyclopedic and dictionary facts as well as human nuances which brings it's comprehension and statements generated during the gameshow "Jeopardy" is almost amazing. I say almost because he still got a number of questions really wrong. But the evidence is clear. The future is here.

Watson is amalgamation of Jonathan Swift's writing machine, Bill Chamberlain's RACTER, and Christian B&ouml;k's Robopoetics personified Susan Blackmore's scenario of the "third replicator".

Though I long for the computer aboard the USS Enterprise. Watson is definitely a step towards it.</p>
