<p>I'm proud to say that I grew up in the age of film. I had my first film camera which was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/110_film" target="_blank">110 film camera</a>&nbsp;and I took my first pictures. But to see my work I had to give them to my father who then had the film developed which would usually take me a week at least to get my prints back.

This childhood of mine is no longer possible in the current generation.

I still remember the first time I had a digital camera and now the resolution my camera had back then is in my smart phone. How far have we gone in 20 years.

Now cameras are everywhere, any child can operate a digital camera and most people are not aware of what these things can possibly do.

In our Computational Camera's class last semester where we were asked what these cameras could do, I think the end of the world would be triggered by X-ray glassses.

I'm not sure yet on where to take this. I'll expand this in a later post.</p>
