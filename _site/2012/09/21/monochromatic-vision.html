<p>The way I see how a computer would see things would be in black and white. This image is me in my apartment while my other computer is on my work table behind me while I watch television.&nbsp;

I sometimes have a nagging feeling that the computer camera is sometimes watching me yet it does nothing. In photography, even in the digital form black and white or monochromatic images are much better is capturing the best quality no matter how advanced the sensor of the camera may be.

Black and white is what I believe similar to the ones and zeros that computers deal with everyday.&nbsp;

This is in part of the the only thing the imaging chip has to worry about is black or white and the gray spectrum in between. Basing it on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zone_System" target="_blank">Ansel Adam's zone system</a>, the monochromatic range is wider than that of the visible color range. In my opinion, the greater the resolution, the greater the depth, the more the camera is able to see. The more the camera sees, the more a connected computer can parse that data.
