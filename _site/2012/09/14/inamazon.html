<p>INAMAZON is a modification of the word "Amazon" in Filipino to mean to pass through Amazon in which I am referring to the online retailer which refers to anything purchased online.

Much like the name Xerox. The use of brand names in Filipino culture is much easier to refer to the products or services introduced into the country rather than act itself which is photocopy.</p>
