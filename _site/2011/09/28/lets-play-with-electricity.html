This week doesn't require any mad programming skills and just basic electrical know how.

With the help of helping hands, this allows me to both hold the points together to get a reading on the multimeter and take a picture at the same time. Of course this one beeps.

 So does this one. Notice that I wired the board in such a way that both sides have power and ground.

Which of the images above has a complete circuit?

But fun question, does electricity pass through our bodies? Yes, but we still provide enough resistance that the 5V from the Arduino will not shock us nor complete the circuit.

And just like that with a resistor and all, we have another lit LED.

Interesting that the LED uses approximately 1.72 V out of 5V.

<a title="electricity by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6183142451/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6175/6183142451_178a37558e.jpg" alt="electricity" width="500" height="375" /></a>

The amount of electricity passing through the resistor is approximately 3.31 V. Add that up it's almost 5V. At least we know where all the power is going.

Let's add a switch and see if it affects the power flow.

Well apparently all it does is just cut off the power completely.

<a title="electricity by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6183693422/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6173/6183693422_4b625a2260.jpg" alt="electricity" width="500" height="375" /></a>

Notice that the gree light is not as bright as the red one. Different color LEDs have different power requirements.

Notice the difference between the power usage of the green and the red LED and the amount that passes through the resistor.

<a title="electricity by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6183755146/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6154/6183755146_ae4c3095d3.jpg" alt="electricity" width="500" height="375" /></a>

Now when we add another LED, they don't light up as brightly as before.

<a title="electricity by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6183257411/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6167/6183257411_89f65e575b.jpg" alt="electricity" width="500" height="375" /></a>

The resistor is now only getting 0.14 V.

<a title="electricity by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6183276233/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6162/6183276233_102ea5c3e2.jpg" alt="electricity" width="500" height="375" /></a>

But if we re-arrange the LED's that they're all being powered by a single line instead of a series of leads. It's a whole lot brighter.

<a title="electricity by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6183810706/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6156/6183810706_fcfbbc9141.jpg" alt="electricity" width="500" height="375" /></a>

The resistor is using up 3.38V. while the LED's are at 1.65 V.

<a title="electricity by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6183824650/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6170/6183824650_255116492e.jpg" alt="electricity" width="500" height="375" /></a>

But what excatly do these switches do? As long as they close the circuit, they can be used in a variety of ways.

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6191300926/" title="pcomp by mdelamerced, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6123/6191300926_0177f683bb.jpg" width="500" height="375" alt="pcomp"></a>

In this setup, any one of the switches will light up the LED.

But in a series wiring setup such as the one below, only by pressing all three switches will light up the LED.

Next week...my stupid pet trick.</p>
