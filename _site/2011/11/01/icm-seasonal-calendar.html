<p>For my ICM midterms, I thought of things to make that would look cool but at the same time, represent me or at least the artistic side of me if there ever is one. I decided to make a season clock.

I come from a country where the only sesons we have is hot and rain. Not much to choose from there so it always facinated me when I travelled when we encountered different seasons. It was only when I was working when I encountered fall and winter which always seemed the most interesting in photographs.

Last year, my father and I went to Yosemite National Park, it was my first trip to the park and of course we brought along a 4x5 camera much like Ansel Adams did.

We went there almost one year exactly to date and I took inspiration from these pictures that I shot while I was there.

The whole park was practically yellow and yellow leaves were falling all around us the entire time. It was beautiful. I decided to make seasonal clock after this.

Depending on the month on your computer, the season changes. For the fall, I made an approximation of yellow leaves falling. Winter is represented by snow and spring is shown in the form of cherry blossoms taken in reference from this photo.

There is a lot of potential to add to the sketch by adding Christimas lights between Thanksgiving and January, Halloween decorations for October and so on. You can see the seasons change by changing the internal clock of your computer. Note: seasons are based on the Northern Hemesphere.
