<p>ABS-CBN is the largest broadcasting network in the Philppines with a long history attached to it.

It is the 2nd TV station to open is Asia following the NHK in Japan. It was originally known as Bolinao Electronics Corporation which was built by James Lindenberg. BEC was renamed Alto Broadcasting System when Antonio Quirino, brother of then President Elpidio Qurino who used mass media (radio/television) to get his brother re-elected.

In 1956, publishing giant Chronicle Broadcasting Network, owned by business scion Don Eugenio Lopez, Sr. purchased ABS from Lindenberg and Quirino to form ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation.

The logo composed of malayan styled letters for the letters ABS and CBN. The three rings represent the 3 large islands of the Philippines signifying the coverage of the network enclosed in a square box which represents fair and balanced programming. The arrangement of the rings and the rectangle is formed in the shape of a broadcasting tower.

When color TV was introduced in the 60s, the primary colors for transmission were used to add color to the rings.

In 1972, the station and all it's subsidiaries were shut down upon the declaration of Martial Law and did not re-open until after the 1986 EDSA revolution where the original owners who were forced into exile returned and reclaimed their station.

The pre-martial law logo was used until the end of 1999.

In 2000, a coorporate decision was made into re-designing the logo to meet the current demands. ABS-CBN is no longer a radio and television network, but now has other mediums such as the web, magazine publishing, motion picture studio and international distribution among it's business. The logo was designed in-house.

The new logo did not deviate much from the original logo as it had to still look like ABS-CBN. The typography was modified into a modern malayan style from the original and moving all entire wording at the bottom to firmly represent the company name. The square box no longer surrounded the logo as it did before but is what is considered "outside" but remains in the logo.

The logo sits well in a vertical and a horizontal format depending on the requirements as well as light and dark backgrounds.
