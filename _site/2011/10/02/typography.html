<p>This week's CommLab2D homework is about typography.

So how would my name look like in typography?

<a title="name01 by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6204654605/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6149/6204654605_54c7ee4035.jpg" alt="name01" width="386" height="500" /></a>

I've selected 3 serif and sans serif fonts to fit the bill. From my name it's important for me for the font to have prominent A's, M's and D's.

<a title="name02 by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6205170498/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6152/6205170498_0dc73b8c06.jpg" alt="name02" width="461" height="127" /></a>

It's important for me to present the "A" of my mother's maiden name due to the fact that there are technically 3 Melissa dela Merced's in the family. The only letter that separates us is the middle initial and I've selected it here with Serif font, "Bergamo".
 <a title="name03 by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6205170554/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6004/6205170554_c677ea7492.jpg" alt="name03" width="500" height="102" /></a>

My name has Spanish origins and traditionally the word "dela" is not counted alphabetically and is set in the lowercase. Using the font "Merriweather", this allows a balance in the letters that are important to me without having to sacrifice any.

<a title="name04 by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6205170634/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6157/6205170634_ba937c5768.jpg" alt="name04" width="500" height="76" /></a>

"Quattrocento" is an interesting font for me that I would like set in steel infront of my future office. This it almost looks like a sans serif font but the A's and the M's give it away.

<a title="name05 by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6204654919/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6159/6204654919_29a631884f.jpg" alt="name05" width="500" height="91" /></a>

"Days" is a sans serif font that I would like to put on the side of a race car. There is a certain amount of flair in the A while maintaining the orderliness of the rest of my name which I would describe me as a somewhat traditional person.

<a title="name06 by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6204654979/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6163/6204654979_f4d6618a4d.jpg" alt="name06" width="500" height="122" /></a>

I've set my name in this order since I share the same initials as my mother. "Salaryman" represents my family. The way that it lines up the MDM together.

<a title="name07 by mdelamerced, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mdelamerced/6204655047/"><img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6160/6204655047_acce14c5f8.jpg" alt="name07" width="500" height="65" /></a>

"Hattenschweiler" is what I call the Star Trek font or how your name is usually written in rallycars. I place it here as my fondness for both.

These are just a few of my experiments in typography. Two of which is based on what I was feeling over the weekend while the other came from a random word I saw on the internet.</p>
